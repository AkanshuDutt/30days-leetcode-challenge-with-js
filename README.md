# 30 Days LeetCode Challenge with JavaScript 🖥️

I am doing a **30 Days LeetCode Challenge** using **JavaScript**.  
This repository contains my daily problem-solving journey, including solutions, notes, and explanations.

Each day’s challenge is organized in its own folder:
- `day-01`, `day-02`,  
- JavaScript solutions are in problem.js.  
- Problem statements and notes are in `problem.md`.

This challenge helps me improve my **problem-solving skills**, **JavaScript knowledge**, and **algorithmic thinking**.
